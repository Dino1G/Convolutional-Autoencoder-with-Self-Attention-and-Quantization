Face2Sketch generation is an important task in computer vision and has wide applications in digital entertainment, forensic art, and facial recognition systems. In this paper, we propose a novel model, Convolutional Autoencoder with Self-Attention and Quantization (CASQ), for generating high-quality sketches from facial images. CASQ utilizes a combination of self-attention and quantization techniques to capture the complex features of faces and generate detailed and accurate sketches. We compare the performance of CASQ with two other models, deep autoencoder and variational autoencoder, on CUHK face sketch dataset. Our results demonstrate that CASQ outperforms the other models in terms of both visual quality and quantitative evaluation metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the dataset.
